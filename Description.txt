The code is written on Python Keras using TF BackEnd.
The X input has be processed using StandardScaling and
the Y input has been processed using Hot Label Encoding.

Approach 1:
	Define a simple ANN model, using keras weight 
initializers and trained it using RMSPROP opt with 200+ 
batch size and 200 epochs. Acheived 93% test ACC

Approach 2:
	Define a simple ANN model but with K-FOLd method, 
having 4 FOLDs on the train data. Acheiving 92% Test Accuracy


Succesful approach is the 1st approach having 93% test acc
